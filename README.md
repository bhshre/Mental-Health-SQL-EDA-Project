# Mental Health Analysis Using SQL + Python

This project aims to analyze mental health patient data to uncover insights related to mood, therapy effectiveness, stress, diagnosis trends, and treatment progress. The goal is to demonstrate SQL and EDA skills while drawing actionable insights for data-driven mental health interventions.

---

##  Dataset

- **File:** `https://github.com/bhshre/Mental-Health-SQL-EDA-Project/blob/main/mental_health_data_clean.csv`
- **Fields include:** Age, Gender, Mood Score, Therapy Type, Sleep Quality, Stress Level, Diagnosis, and Treatment Progress.

---

## Business Questions Answered

- What is the gender distribution of patients?
- Which therapy type leads to the highest treatment progress?
- Is there a link between mood and stress levels?
- What is the most common diagnosis?
- Does sleep quality relate to stress?
- Which diagnosis shows the highest recovery progress?
---

##  Tools Used

- **SQL:** For initial data cleaning & querying.
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib):** For EDA & visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:** Execution environment.
- **GitHub:** For project versioning and showcasing.

##  Visualizations

### 1.  Average Mood Score by Therapy
![Avg Mood by Therapy](https://github.com/bhshre/Mental-Health-SQL-EDA-Project/blob/main/images/avg_mood_by_therapy.png)

- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) shows the highest average mood score, indicating strong effectiveness.

---

### 2.  Mood vs Stress
![Mood vs Stress](https://github.com/bhshre/Mental-Health-SQL-EDA-Project/blob/main/images/mood_vs_stress.png)

- There’s no simple inverse relationship — high mood doesn’t always mean low stress. Other factors could be influencing this.

---

### 3.  Treatment Progress by Diagnosis

- Panic Disorder patients show the highest average treatment progress; Bipolar Disorder shows the least.

---

### 4.  Sleep Quality vs Stress Level
![Sleep vs Stress](https://github.com/bhshre/Mental-Health-SQL-EDA-Project/blob/main/images/sleep_vs_stress.png)

- Good sleep doesn’t always equal low stress; even those with good sleep (score 8) can have high stress.

---

### 5.  Gender Distribution of Patients
![Gender Distribution](https://github.com/bhshre/Mental-Health-SQL-EDA-Project/blob/main/images/gender_distribution.png)

- The dataset includes a diverse group of patients with a slight female majority. 

---

### 6.  Treatment Progress by Therapy Type
![Progress by Therapy](https://github.com/bhshre/Mental-Health-SQL-EDA-Project/blob/main/images/treatment_progress_by_therapy.png)

- **CBT** leads to the highest treatment progress, followed by **Psychoanalysis**.
- **Mindfulness-Based Therapy** shows the lowest average progress.

---

##  Key Insights

- **Gender:** Both males and females are seeking treatment — indicating growing awareness.
- **Therapy Effectiveness:** CBT has the highest mood improvement; Mindfulness-Based Therapy the lowest.
- **Sleep vs Stress:** No strong inverse correlation.
- **Most Prevalent Diagnosis:** Generalized Anxiety.
- **Highest Progress:** Panic Disorder.
- **Lowest Progress:** Bipolar Disorder.
- **Complex Mood-Stress Relationship:** Not always linear; influenced by diagnosis and therapy.

##  Final Conclusion

This analysis highlights the diverse outcomes of different therapies and diagnoses in mental health treatment. It emphasizes the need for personalized interventions and shows how data can support better clinical decisions. The project combines SQL querying, Python-based EDA, and business insights — making it suitable for roles in Data Science and Data Analytics.
